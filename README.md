# Password-Generator
A password generator is a software tool that helps users to create strong, random passwords that are difficult to guess or crack. It works by randomly generating a string of characters, which can include upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Password generators typically allow users to specify the length and complexity of the password they require, and can also provide additional features such as the ability to exclude certain characters or to generate multiple passwords at once. The purpose of using a password generator is to improve the security of your online accounts by creating strong and unique passwords that are difficult for hackers to guess or crack.
